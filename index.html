<h1>Welcome to Yaniv's Storyvers</h1>
<h2>Why I love stories so much</h2>
<p>Stories tap into a fundamental human desire to explore and experience new things.</p>
They transport us to fantastical worlds or immerse us in relatable situations, all from the comfort of our couch.<br> 
The thrill of suspense, the satisfaction of a character's growth, and the emotional connection we forge with them keep us engaged.<br>
Stories are like mini-adventures, offering a fun escape from reality while leaving us with a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us.

<p>You got it right, I don't just talk the talk, I walk the walk.</p>
<p>I compiled and delevered a 45 minute presentation on my favorite genre books for a national event to a live audience.
It was extremely challenging with many creteria and moving parts but also gratifying. 
<p>In my eyes, It was a lot like a standared SDLC cycle:</p><ol>
	<li>Acting as a one man show, I had the privelage of coming up with the initial idea for the product.</li>
	<li>Then I analyzed the probability and demand for it.</li>
	<li>Next, I created the basic story flow both visually and verbally.</li>
	<li>After that, I run a demo, and received feedback from peers on the content and the technical aspects in order to deliver the best product to the client.</li>
	<li>Lastly, I implemented the feedback and got great responses from the audience.</li>
  <li>While there's always room for growth and improvement, I do see this event and process as a great success in front of the client!</li></ol>
